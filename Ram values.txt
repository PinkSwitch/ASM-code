Write random bytes to $01BF2C (Bonus games per world)
01C288 should be 00, 8B should be 80
If you've completed a check, should it be yellow on the normal menu even on replays?

Add Secret Lens and default hidden visibility X
Idea for setting: Disable Autoscroll: Prevent $0C1E and $0C20 from being written to
World Keys/Keysanity (Save whether a door has been locked or unlocked. Turn individual keys into checks. Keep a counter of keys per world.)
